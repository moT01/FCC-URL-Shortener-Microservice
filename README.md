##### Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.
##### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
- User Story:  I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
- User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
- User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
